* Description: Have you ever had a free evening, and not known what to do with yourself? Have you ever found yourself in a rut, doing the same things over and over? You're not alone: studies have shown that people have a great deal of trouble choosing a random option from a set. Luckily, the Reserved Judgement team has your back - with Quantum Activities, you'll never be at a loss for what to do. Just choose one of the four options from the drop down (either movies, restaurants, entertainment venues, or video games) and enjoy breaking out of your habits.
